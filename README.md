# ðŸ§  Logistic Regression from Scratch

A custom implementation of Logistic Regression in Python built from the ground up â€” no `scikit-learn`, no shortcuts. Just raw NumPy, clean design, and full control.

This project is educational and modular, designed to help you deeply understand the internal workings of logistic regression, including:

- Batch gradient descent  
- L1/L2 regularization  
- Evaluation metrics  
- Feature normalization  
- Predict probabilities and class labels

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- âœ… Train on binary classification datasets  
- âœ… Supports L1 and L2 regularization  
- âœ… Gradient descent optimization  
- âœ… Predict both class labels and probabilities  
- âœ… Custom learning rate and iteration control  
- âœ… Convergence tracking with loss plots  
- âœ… Feature normalization support (optional)  
- âœ… Clean, OOP-based API inspired by `scikit-learn`
