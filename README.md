# 🧠 Custom Logistic Regression from Scratch

A fully functional implementation of Logistic Regression in pure Python and NumPy — built from scratch to understand the internals of how classification works.

This repository is intended as a learning project for exploring the core ideas behind logistic regression, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn.
